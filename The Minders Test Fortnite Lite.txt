The Minders, Test

TPS gameplay test mechanics:
1. Character feature:
- Fully humanoid rig with animations. can use external source
	2-3h
- Character can jump, crouch and strafe right/left/forward/backward.
	2h
- Character can sprint.
	1h
- Character is equip with two weapons
	2h
  + Rifle. Standard M4A1 with simple aim (no aim dot).
  	1h
  + Sniper. AWP with aim dot.
  	4h
- Character can swap between two weapons.
	2h
- Camera at TPS. Same angle like fortnite.
	1h
- Character should aim at the center of the screen.
	1h
- Character do NOT aim while sprinting.
	1h

2. Create a game mode. 5v5 deathmatch mode (two teams)
	? Is this a single player game against other bots OR is it a bot only game OR you will have the ability to select?
- No friendly fire.
	30m
- One kill is one point.
	30m
- Whichever team has the higher points win the game.
	3h
- Match length is 5 minutes.
	30m
- Draw if the two teams has the same point.
	1.5h

3. Bot behaviours:
_ Bots move randomly around the map with navigation (obstacle avoidance).
	Is it ok to use to use navmesh?
- There would be two profiles of bot (randomly assigned on creating game).

+ Aggressive :
   - Bot can move random on the match.
		~ Bot can move randomly on the ground
   - Bot detection distance would be wide (not limited by the view range).
		? Does this mean the bot can see through walls/obstacles?
   - Bot can shoot player upon meeting and only change the direction if the new enemy is closer)
		? Does this mean the bot will always attack the closest enemy?
   - Bot only shoots player if the distance is at the certain range. If not the bot would move to an optimal position to take the shot.
		1.5h
   - If the enemy is too far from the bot, bot would not fire but sprint to optimal position to take the shot.
		1.5h

 + Safe :
    - Bot can move random on the match.
    - Bot detection distance would be wide (not limited by the view range).
    - Bot can shoot player upon meeting and only change the direction if the new enemy is closer)
    - Bot only shoots player if the distance is at the certain range. If not the bot would move to an optimal position to take the shot.
    - If the enemy is too far from the bot, bot would not fire but sprint to optimal position to take the shot.
    - Bot will run away if the health is low (you decide). Preferably move to teammates. Bot would have a detection radius on the teammates.


Bot difficulty would be dictated by :
+ Bot Speed (sprint and normally move).
+ Bot Fire accuracy.
	â€¢ Add some slight randomness
+ Bot detection in generals
	?

4. Visual:

	3h

- Camera should occluded when closed to obstacles.
	? Do you want the camera to move forward if the player backs into a wall? Should the camera avoid looking through obstacles?

7. Other gameplay mechanics.
- Gun should have its own recoil and visually present on both camera and trail/ bullet holes.
	? Camera shake?

 2. Player battle logs (empty if the first time entering the game):		//Save these directly to file after each match (as per instructions)
  + Kills
  + Deaths.

 (Only count the match actually ends. Mid game force quit is not allowed).

- Load the current config on the next loading game.
	4h

	2h
- Only recreate new game config if the last config is deleted.
	? Only create a new game config if there is no config file found?
	? Does the user have the option to delete the config file in game?
