Required data that the bots will need access to so I know the required fields to enter into the AI agent
• Random positions on the map?
• Opponent position
	List of all opponents
	Distance from the opponent
• Obstacles
	Raycast fan
• CharacterController
	Move
	Jump
	Sprint
	Crouch
• Current Target Opponent

AI Logic
==========
Entry:

Seq: Retreat
	Cond: if health is low
	Act: retreat to teammates
		//Find all teammates within a specified radius, move to the average

Seq: Targeting
	Cond: if there is a new target that's in view
	Sel:
		Seq:
			Cond:if there is no current target
			Act: Set new target as current target
		Seq:
			Cond: if the new target is in shooting range
			Act: set new target as current target with a delay

Seq: Attack or Chase
	Cond: if there is a current target
	Sel:
		Seq:
			Cond: if current target is in range
			Act: Attack
		Act: Chase

Act: Hunt
	(if Health is good, no new targets, no current target)
		//Navigate towards the average of all enemies + random direction every 3 seconds
		//Minimum move distance, max movedistance, max random angle



	Look for a closer enemy than the current one and wait a short time before switching to the new one
Attack target enemy

1. Attack enemy
2.

Entry
	Selector

		MoveRandomSeq; Moves slightly towards average of enemy team + random angle
			Walk slightly to a random direction + toward enemy team
